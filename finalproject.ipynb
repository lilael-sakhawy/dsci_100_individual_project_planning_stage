    "<h4> Background Information </h4>\n",
    "A UBC Computer Science research group, led by Frank Wood, is collecting data regarding the ways in which different people play video games. The research group is using a Minecraft server that links to an external site in order to record the actions of each player as they use the server. The research group must make accommodations to manage the attracted players, ensuring they have sufficient resources such as software liscences and server hardware, while finding ways to target their recruitment efforts. The following investigation asks the predictive question, \"Can age, player experience and average playing session time predict the time spent playing Minecraft?\" and will address the question using a K-nearest neighbors predictive model.\n",

    "Issues: the data set appears to be untidy since the start_time and end_time variables contain both a date and a time. To make the data tidy, the dates and times will need to be separated into different columns (columns for day, month, year, hour and minutes for start and end times). The original_start_time and original_end_time variables lack the necessary precision so will likely be irrelevant to the data analysis."
